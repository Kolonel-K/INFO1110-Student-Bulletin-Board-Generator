Python Exercise: “Student Bulletin Board Generator”

Problem Statement

You are given:
	1.	A list of n student names.
	2.	A list of n sets of marks (each student has marks out of 100).

Your task is to generate a Bulletin Board that shows each student’s average score, ranking, grade band, and whether they were given a grace mark.

Requirements
	1.	Valid Marks Condition
                •	Each student must have exactly 5 marks.
                •	If a student does not have 5 marks, skip that student’s record (do not calculate anything for them, but continue processing others).
	2.	Grace Mark Rule
                •	If a student’s average is less than 60 but would become ≥60 by adding a single grace mark to their average mark, then:
                •	Add +1 to that average mark.
                •	Mark "Grace Applied = Yes".
                •	If grace cannot help them, mark "Grace Applied = No".
	3.	Average & Grade Calculation
                •	Compute each student’s average marks (rounded to 2 decimal places).
                •	Assign grade bands:
                •	85–100 → High Distinction
                •	75–84.99 → Distinction
                •	65–74.99 → Credit
                •	60–64.99 → Pass
                •	<60 → Fail
	4.	Ranking System
                •	Sort students by average score (descending).
                •	The top three should be displayed as "1st rank", "2nd rank", "3rd rank".
                •	Remaining students should be numbered sequentially starting from 4, 5, 6, …
	5.	Mutability Demonstration
                •	Store marks initially as a tuple (immutable).
                •	Convert them to a list when applying grace marks (mutable).

students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eva", "Frank", "George", "Helen", "Ivy", "Jack"]
marks = [
      (95, 89, 92, 90, 91),   # Alice
    (85, 86, 87, 88, 82),   # Bob
    (78, 79, 80, 77, 75),   # Carol
    (92, 90, 88, 87, 86),   # David
    (65, 68, 70, 72, 69),   # Eva
    (59, 61, 63, 60, 58),   # Frank 
    (40, 45, 50, 42, 38),   # George 
    (82, 84, 81, 83, 85),   # Helen
    (55, 57, 53, 59, 60),   # Ivy 
    (88, 91, 93, 89, 90)    # Jack
]
